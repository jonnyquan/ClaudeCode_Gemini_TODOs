## Task Management Best Practices

### 1. Task Breakdown Principles
- Single Responsibility: Each task does one thing
- Verifiable: Clear acceptance criteria
- Time-Controlled: Smallest task ‚â§ 3 days
- Independence: Minimize dependencies

### 2. Priority Management
- Only 1 P0 task per day
- No more than 3 P1 tasks
- Regularly reassess priorities
- Beware of urgent but unimportant tasks

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Update task status daily
- Record blockers and risks promptly
- Keep task descriptions up to date
- Use time tracking tools

### 4. Team Collaboration
- Clear task assignment
- Clear dependencies
- Communicate progress promptly
- Regular reviews and improvements

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Safety Conventions

**IMPERATIVE: The following are mandatory technical red lines for all tasks.**

1.  **NEVER Overwrite, ALWAYS Append**
    - When modifying files like `.env`, `requirements.txt`, or other list-based config files, you **must** use append (not overwrite). This is the highest-priority rule to prevent data loss.

2.  **Evaluate Deletions Carefully**
    - Before deleting any code or files, assess their potential future value. If possibly useful, prefer archiving over direct deletion.

3.  **Use Virtual Environment**
    - All `pip` installs and `python` commands **must** be run in the project's `.venv` to ensure isolation and consistency.

## üìñ Protocol for Handling Large, Complex Tasks

**IMPERATIVE: This protocol is for turning large, vague tasks into clear, actionable plans.**

### Trigger Condition
- When a large task (e.g., L3 Epic or above, or any work expected to take more than 3 days) appears in `PROJECT_TODOS.md`, this protocol must be activated.

### Execution Process
1.  **Create Dedicated Management Files**:
    - **Must** create two new `.md` files named after the task:
      - `[TASK_NAME]_PLAN.md`
      - `[TASK_NAME]_PROGRESS.md`
    - *Example: For a task named "Exchange Testnet Integration", create `TESTNET_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` and `TESTNET_INTEGRATION_PROGRESS.md`.*

2.  **Use Blueprint Templates**:
    - **Must** use files in the `reference_materials/` directory as templates:
      - `[TASK_NAME]_PLAN.md` **must** be based on the structure/content of `reference_materials/CHATEXCEL_ACTION_PLAN.md`.
      - `[TASK_NAME]_PROGRESS.md` **must** be based on `reference_materials/CHATEXCEL_PROGRESS.md`.

3.  **Update Main TODO List**:
    - The original large task in `PROJECT_TODOS.md` **must** be updated.
    - Its description should be simplified and **must** include links to the new `_PLAN.md` and `_PROGRESS.md` files for quick navigation.
    - *Example: `[ ] [INFRA-001] Exchange Testnet Integration (see: TESTNET_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)`*

4.  **Execution & Tracking**:
    - Daily, detailed task updates should be made in the new `_PROGRESS.md` file.
    - The main task status (todo/in progress/done) in `PROJECT_TODOS.md` should stay in sync with the overall status in `_PROGRESS.md`.
